# Example Pepper/Spotify Agent Interface

The Bingo Demo is an example application that construct an agent interfacing with a Pepper Robot and Spotify to play musical bingo.

It is build fully in Javascript and makes full use of ES6 features like modules. As a consequence it only runs on browsers supporting this.

## Installing

There is no install required, the application is purely client side javascript. It does require a webserver to run though. Any webserver will do. We recommend either Node's [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or Python's [SimpleHTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html).
